From the results of the trace files, we see that the eight stage pipeline uses approximately 2.72 times as many cycles as the five stage pipeline.

Since we are assuming the clock frequency of the eight-stage pipeline is double that of the five-stage pipeline, the efficiency of both programs can be calculated as followed:

Five_stage.c: 
clock frequency = x, cycles = y
time per program = cycles per program divided by clock frequency = y/x

Eight_stage.c:
	Clock frequency = 2x, cycles = 2.72y
	Time per program = 2.72y/2x = 1.36y/x

From this we can see that the eight stage design requires approximately 1.36 times more duration for the program to run compared to the five stage one, concluding that even with twice the clock frequency, the eight stage design is still less efficient than the five stage design.
